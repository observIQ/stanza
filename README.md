# Stanza is moving to OpenTelemetry

Stanza has been contributed to the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) project and will be intergrated into the [OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector). 
  

# About Stanza

Stanza is a fast and lightweight log transport and processing agent. It's designed as a modern replacement for Fluentd, Fluent Bit, and Logstash. Stanza can run as a standalone agent on all major operating systems, or it can be embedded directly into any Golang application.
