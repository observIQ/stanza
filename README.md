# About Stanza

Stanza is a fast and lightweight log transport and processing agent. It's designed as a modern replacement for Fluentd, Fluent Bit, and Logstash and can run as a standalone agent on all major operating systems. Stanza is also highly integrated to perform seamlessly with the applications in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) based production environments.

## OpenTelemetry

Stanza has been contributed to the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) project and will be intergrated into the [OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector). 

# Features

- Flexible
    - Supports many different input types such as file, journald, windows events, tcp / udp, and external APIs (cloudwatch, azure log analytics) as well as parsing with json and regex.
    - Easily extended by writing an "operator" or "plugin" which is just a unit of code that performs a task such as reading data from a source, parsing data, or shipping data.
- Pre-built Plugins
    - Over 80 Plugins have been pre-built and are ready to be configured.
- Lightweight with low resource consumption
    - Uses next to no resource while idling. It does not pollute the system with tons of clutter, it exists strictly in /opt/observiq/stanza with just a few files.
- Written in pure Go
    - Everything is self contained into a single binary, there are no external dependencies.
- High Performance
    - Stanza is lightweight, blazing-fast, and designed to scale.

## Supported [Plugins](https://github.com/observIQ/stanza-plugins)

 These are many of the Plugins supported by Stanza, with more being developed all the time. View a full list of Plugins [here](https://github.com/observIQ/stanza-plugins/tree/master/plugins).

# Quick Start

## Installation

To install Stanza, we recommend using our single-line installer provided with each release. Stanza will automatically be running as a service upon completion. 

### Linux/macOS
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSlL https://github.com/observiq/stanza/releases/latest/download/unix-install.sh)" unix-install.sh
```
### Windows
```pwsh
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 ; Invoke-Expression ((New-Object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://github.com/observiq/stanza/releases/latest/download/windows-install.ps1')); Log-Agent-Install
```

### Kubernetes
For Kubernetes, there are several guides to install and configure Stanza found [here](./examples/k8s).

## Configuration

To get started navigate to the `config.yaml` file in the Stanza install directory, located in the following locations by default:

- Linux: `/opt/observiq/stanza`  
- MacOS: `/Users/<user>/observiq/stanza`  
- Windows: `C:\observiq\stanza`

You can utilize [operators](./docs/operators/README.md) and [plugins](./docs/plugins.md) in a pipeline to easily configure Stanza to ship logs to your target destination.

Stanza also offers several outputs to be configured for sending data, including: 

- [Stdout](./docs/operators/stdout.md)
- [File](./docs/operators/file_output.md)
- [Google Cloud Logging](./docs/operators/google_cloud_output.md)

In the below examples, Stanza is configured to ship logs to Google Cloud logging using the file_input operator, and the MySQL plugin. You will need to have a `credentials.json` for your GCP environment which can be generated by following Google's documentation [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).

### Operators
This `config.yaml` collects logs from a file and sends them to Google Cloud. A full list of available operators can be found [here](./docs/operators/README.md).

```yaml
pipeline:
  # An example input that monitors the contents of a file.
  # For more info: https://github.com/observIQ/stanza/blob/master/docs/operators/file_input.md
  - type: file_input
    include:
    - /sample/file/path.log

  # An example output that sends captured logs to Google Cloud.
  # For more info: https://github.com/observIQ/stanza/blob/master/docs/operators/google_cloud_output.md
  - type: google_cloud_output
    credentials_file: /tmp/credentials.json
```

### Plugins
This `config.yaml` collects logs from MySQL via a plugin and sends them to Google Cloud. By default, MySQL plugin collects general, slow query, and error logs. More details of the MySQL plugin can be viewed [here](https://github.com/observIQ/stanza-plugins/blob/master/plugins/mysql.yaml). A full list of available plugins can be found [here](https://github.com/observIQ/stanza-plugins/blob/master/plugins/).

```yaml
pipeline:
  # An example input that configures a MySQL plugin.
  # For more info: https://github.com/observIQ/stanza/blob/master/docs/plugins.md
  - type: mysql
    enable_general_log: true
    general_log_path: "/var/log/mysql/general.log"

  # An example output that sends captured logs to Google Cloud.
  # For more info: https://github.com/observIQ/stanza/blob/master/docs/operators/google_cloud_output.md
  - type: google_cloud_output
    credentials_file: /tmp/credentials.json
```

That's it! Logs should be streaming to Google Cloud.
